[![CI](https://github.com/mhiro2/gha-pin.nvim/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mhiro2/gha-pin.nvim/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

Inspect and update **pinned SHAs** in GitHub Actions workflows (`uses: owner/repo@<full-commit-sha>`) directly from Neovim.

This plugin is lightweight and practical for day-to-day use.
It parses workflow/action files line-by-line (not a full YAML parser) and is not intended to replace Dependabot/Renovate.

## 💡 Motivation

Pinning GitHub Actions to full commit SHAs is the safest, most reliable approach. Tags can change over time, which can undermine reproducibility and open the door to supply-chain risks. This plugin helps you keep SHA pins up to date.
See: [Security hardening for GitHub Actions - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions)

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Diagnostics**: warns when a pinned SHA is not the latest (default policy: latest release)
- 💬 **Virtual text**: shows `# Latest: <tag> <short-commit-sha>` at end of line (default ON)
- 🔧 **Fix**: updates outdated pins to the latest SHA (whole buffer or range)
- 📖 **Explain**: shows what the plugin resolved for the `uses:` under cursor
- 💾 **Cache**: TTL-based cache (default: 6 hours)
- 🔐 **Auth / transport**: uses [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) via `gh api` when available; falls back to `curl` + `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- 🧭 **Auto check targets**: workflows and composite action metadata files (`.github/actions/**/action.yml|yaml`)

## 📋 Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.9
- [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) (recommended)
- `curl`

## 📦 Installation (lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "mhiro2/gha-pin.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("gha-pin").setup({
      auto_check = { enabled = true },
    })
  end,
}
```

## 🏥 Health Check

Check plugin status and dependencies:

```vim
:checkhealth gha-pin
```

This will verify:
- Neovim version compatibility
- Availability of GitHub CLI (`gh`) and `curl` executables
- Authentication status (`gh` auth or `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
  - Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to a GitHub access token (typically a PAT; see [managing personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).

## 🚀 Usage

### 📝 Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `:GhaPinCheck` | Parse current buffer and update diagnostics/virtual text |
| `:GhaPinFix` | Update outdated pins to latest SHA (whole buffer or visual range) |
| `:GhaPinExplain` | Show resolution details for `uses:` under cursor |
| `:GhaPinCacheClear` | Clear cache |

### 🧪 What is "Latest"?

By default, this plugin resolves "latest" as the **latest release** when available:

1. `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest` -> `tag_name`
2. Resolve tag -> commit SHA via `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/ref/tags/{tag}`
   (and `GET /repos/.../git/tags/{sha}` for annotated tags)
3. If the repo has no releases (404), fallback to `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/tags?per_page=1`

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the repo's release/tag conventions, the resolved SHA may not match your expectation.

### ⏱️ Release Cooldown (Optional)

To avoid pinning to brand-new releases that may be unstable, you can enable a cooldown period:

```lua
require("gha-pin").setup({
  minimum_release_age_seconds = 604800,  -- Wait 1 week after release
})
```

- **Behavior**: If the latest release's tag is newer than the configured age, it's treated as "not eligible yet" (no diagnostic shown).
- **Default**: `0` (disabled) - all releases are immediately eligible.
- **Notes**:
  - Only applies to releases (from `/releases/latest`), not tags fallback.
  - Uses the tag's `tagger.date` for annotated tags; for lightweight tags it uses the commit date (`commit.committer.date`, fallback to `commit.author.date`).
  - Repos without releases (tags fallback) are always eligible.

### ⚠️ Failure behavior

- If resolution fails (network/auth/rate limit/etc.), the plugin will **not** add "outdated" diagnostics for that `uses:`.
- Virtual text may show `# Latest: (resolve failed)`. Use `:GhaPinExplain` to see the error.

### 🧩 Supported patterns

- Included:
  - `uses: owner/repo@<full-commit-sha>`
  - `uses: owner/repo/path@<full-commit-sha>`
- Ignored:
  - `uses: ./path`
  - `uses: docker://...`
  - any `uses:` containing `${{ }}` (dynamic expressions)
  - tag refs like `@v4` (not supported yet)

## ⚙️ Configuration

```lua
require("gha-pin").setup({
  virtual_text = true,
  ttl_seconds = 6 * 60 * 60,
  minimum_release_age_seconds = 0,  -- Optional: cooldown for releases
  github = {
    api_base_url = "https://api.github.com",
    prefer_gh = true,
    token_env = "GITHUB_TOKEN",
  },
  auto_check = {
    enabled = false,
    debounce_ms = 700,
  },
})
```

### 🗒️ auto_check notes

- `auto_check` runs only for workflow files under `.github/workflows/*.yml|yaml` and action metadata files under `.github/actions/**/action.yml|yaml`.
- If you feel this is too noisy/heavy, keep it disabled and run `:GhaPinCheck` manually, or increase `ttl_seconds`.
